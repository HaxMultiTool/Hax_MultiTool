# About
This is the first ever Hax MultiTool concept. still very buggy. I invited a friend of mine (which i wont mention) to help me develop this, and he tried skidding it. Soon updated this to v1.2.1 so his files were still buggy and not up to date with most code updates. this is where i started obfuscating files.
